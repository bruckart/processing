This is a collection of my personal Processing sketches that I've built or adapted over many years. The majority of sketches are explorations into geometric shapes with minimal use of 3rd party libraries. In many cases, my sketches utilize [Jonathan Feinberg's peasycam](http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/).
